This is the Trivia Game, a little game in javascript/bootstrap/jquery.

In order to play it, just answer the questions with one choice each, and click "Submit" in the end of the page.

This project is part of the homework given at the UCLA Coding Bootcamp program (2018), class UCLAWES201802FSF3, and it's very useful to learn things such as functions in javascript and jquery, as well as bootstrap for the html part.

Thank you,
